    This app contains various uses for a dataset of English quotes. The 
    **Quote Search** page allows you to search for quotes with a particular 
    meaning by entering a text string, and the **Quote Visualiser** page allows 
    you to see the distribution of quotes by topic.

    ### About the dataset
    The dataset contains almost 500,000 quotes scraped from popular websites 
    such as goodreads, BrainyQuote, Famous Quotes & Authors, and Curated 
    Quotes. The dataset was made publicly available in 2018 by the authors 
    Shivali Goel, Rishi Madhok, Shweta Garg. Further details can be found
